# Meet-Up EventPlaner
## Project 1 for Udacity's Senior Web Developmer program.

This is a project focused on developing best practices in form design. The application allows a user to register and log in. The user can then modify user info in the profile section, create an event or browse events in the Events sections.

To run the application locally, navigate to the root directory and run `npm install`, `bower install` and finally `gulp`.

A live demo can be found here: [live demo](https://udacity-event-planner.herokuapp.com/#!/ "udacity-event-planner").
